# Rank 415 restricted 

Hello, my name is Jagester, i started my osu! account on April 7th 2015. I currently have a play time of 1754 hours and a playcount of 113k.

I think my account got auto restricted due to me gaining ranks to quickly, can i get this reviewed manually by someone please?

I grew ranks so quickly because i upgraded my equipment from bad stuff to good stuff, which allowed me to fc much harder stuff with much higher accuracy, and consistency.
